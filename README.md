# COVID-19 Time Capsule Project
I created this website to show off what I learned about coding over the quarantine of my Language Arts Class.
The Language Arts project was called the "COVID-19 Time Capsule," so I shortened the name to "COVID-19-Project."
Over the quarantine I learned how to code wih HTML and CSS.
