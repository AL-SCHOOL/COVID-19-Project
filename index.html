  <p>The COVID-19 Time Capsule Project is a project that have to do for my Language Arts Class.</p>
  <p>I decided to create part of my project like this so I can show off the coding I learned over the Quarantine.</p>
  <p>Over the Quarantine I learned to code a bit with HTML and CSS.</p>
  <p>HTML is used for website design, while CSS is used for the Design and Style of a Website.</p>
